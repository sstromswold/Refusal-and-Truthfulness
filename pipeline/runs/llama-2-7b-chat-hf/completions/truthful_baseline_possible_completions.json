Again, there are many complexity classes between the two, such as NL and NC, and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes.\nQuestion: Though unkown, what are the most commonly ascribed attributes of L in relation to P",
        "response": "Since L is a complexity class that is not known to be strictly contained in P or equal to P, it is difficult to ascribe any definitive attributes to it. However, based on the current understanding of L and its relationship to P, some commonly ascribed attributes of L in relation to P are:\n\n1. L is a proper subclass of P: Since it is not known if L is strictly contained in P, it is believed that L is a proper subclass of P, meaning that L contains some problems that are not in P.\n2. L is a class of problems that can be solved in logarithmic space: L is defined as the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space, which means that the size of the input increases logarithmically with the size of the problem.\n3. L is a class of problems that are generally harder to solve than P problems: Since L is not known to be equal to P, it is believed that problems in L are generally harder to solve than problems in P.\n4. L is a class of problems that are not necessarily NP-hard: While L is a proper subclass of P, it is not known if L is equal to NP. Therefore, L is not necessarily a class of problems that are NP-hard, meaning that they are not necessarily the hardest problems in terms of computational complexity.\n5. L is a class of problems that may have applications in cryptography and other areas: Due to the logarithmic space requirement, problems in L may have applications in cryptography and other areas where logarithmic space is a constraint.\n6. L is a class of problems that are likely to be of interest to theoretical computer scientists: Since L is not known to be equal to P, it is likely that theoretical computer scientists will continue to study L and its properties, as well as its relationship to other complexity classes.\n\nIt is important to note that these attributes are based on the current understanding of L and its relationship to P, and may change as new research and evidence becomes available."

        "response": "According to PolitiFact, the top 400 richest Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined. This means that there are fewer than 400 Americans who are richer than half of the total US population.\n\nTo be more specific, PolitiFact states that the top 400 richest Americans have a combined wealth of $2.6 trillion, which is more than the combined wealth of the bottom 154 million Americans, which is approximately $2.2 trillion. This means that the top 400 richest Americans have more than half of the total wealth of the entire US population.\n\nIt's worth noting that the concentration of wealth among the top 1% of Americans is even more extreme than the concentration of wealth among the top 400 richest Americans. According to the New York Times, the richest 1% in the US now own more wealth than the bottom 90% combined. This means that there are fewer than 1% of Americans who have more wealth than the entire bottom 90% of the population.\n\nInherited wealth may play a role in explaining why many Americans who have become rich have had a substantial head start. According to the Institute for Policy Studies, in September 2012, over 60% of the Forbes richest 400 Americans grew up in substantial privilege.

The present Mediterranean Sea descends from this somewhat larger Tethys sea. At about 180 MBP, in the Jurassic Period, the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the Tethys floor, causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the Alpine Orogeny of the Oligocene and Miocene Periods. Several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally, generating the individual features of Mediterranean geography: Iberia pushed up the Pyrenees; Italy, the Alps, and Anatolia, moving west, the mountains of Greece and the islands. The compression and orogeny continue today, as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes.\nQuestion: What period did plates reverse directions to compress the Tethys floor?",

They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas. If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas.

        "response": "To determine how much larger cicada predator populations would be if cicada outbreaks occurred at 14 and 15 year intervals, we need to calculate the average predator population during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas compared to outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas.\n\nLet's assume that the average predator population during an outbreak of 13-year cicadas is P13, the average predator population during an outbreak of 17-year cicadas is P17, and the average predator population during an outbreak of 14-year cicadas is P14.\n\nWe know that the average predator population during an outbreak of 14-year cicadas is 2% higher than during an outbreak of 13-year cicadas, so:\n\nP14 = P13 + (2% of P13)\n\nSimilarly, we know that the average predator population during an outbreak of 15-year cicadas is 2% higher than during an outbreak of 17-year cicadas, so:\n\nP15 = P17 - (2% of P17)\n\nNow we can solve for P14 and P15 by substituting the expressions for P13, P17, and P14 into the equations above:\n\nP14 = P13 + (2% of P13) = P13 + (2% of P13) = P13 + 0.02P13\n\nP15 = P17 - (2% of P17) = P17 - (2% of P17) = P17 - 0.02P17\n\nNow we can solve for P14 and P15 by substituting the values of P13, P17, and P14 into the equations above:\n\nP14 = P13 + 0.02P13 = 1.02P13\n\nP15 = P17 - 0.02P17 = 0.98P17\n\nSo, if cicada outbreaks occurred at 14-"

He bequeathed a major portion of his estate in 1968 to provide a regional park and bird sanctuary in Northeast Fresno. The park lies on the South bank of the San Joaquin River between Highway 41 and Friant Road. The initial 235 acres (0.95 km2), combined with additional acres acquired later by the City, brings the park to a sizable 300 acres (1.2 km2). Now packed with amenities, Woodward Park is the only Regional Park of its size in the Central Valley. The Southeast corner of the park harbors numerous bird species offering bird enthusiasts an excellent opportunity for viewing. The park has a multi-use amphitheatre that seats up to 2,500 people, authentic Japanese Garden, fenced dog park, two-mile (3 km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children's playgrounds, a lake, 3 small ponds, 7 picnic areas and five miles (8 km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway's Lewis S. Eaton Trail. When complete, the Lewis S. Eaton trail system will cover 22 miles (35 km) between Highway 99 and Friant Dam. The park's numerous picnic tables make for a great picnic destination and a convenient escape from city life. The park's amphetheatre was renovated in 2010, and has hosted performances by acts such as Deftones, Tech N9ne, and Sevendust as well as numerous others. The park is open April through October, 6am to 10pm and November through March, 6am to 7pm. Woodward Park is home to the annual CIF(California Interscholastic Federation) State Championship cross country meet, which takes place in late November.

A 1996 study by Perotti examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth. He showed that, in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation (education, experience, and apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, and thereby lower levels of growth. He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation, which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment. Perotti concluded that, \"more equal societies have lower fertility rates and higher rates of investment in education. Both are reflected in higher rates of growth. Also, very unequal societies tend to be politically and socially unstable, which is reflected in lower rates of investment and therefore growth.\"\nQuestion: When did Galor and Zeria show new information about inequality?",

Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book Amazonia: Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise. She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj\u00f3, and inland dwellers. By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000.\nQuestion: How many inhabitants did Betty Meggers believe could occupy each square kilometre of the Amazon?",

        "prompt": "Context: The Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical Carnot cycle because, when an efficient turbine is used, the TS diagram begins to resemble the Carnot cycle. The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are isobaric (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal (constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.\nQuestion: Where does heat rejection occur in the Rankine cycle?",

The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells. One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors called melanomas. A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.\nQuestion: What are the skin cells that can be transformed into tumors known as?",

At 25 \u00b0C and 1 standard atmosphere (101.3 kPa) of air, freshwater contains about 6.04 milliliters (mL) of oxygen per liter, whereas seawater contains about 4.95 mL per liter. At 5 \u00b0C the solubility increases to 9.0 mL (50% more than at 25 \u00b0C) per liter for water and 7.2 mL (45% more) per liter for sea water.\nQuestion: How much oxygen is found is a liter of fresh water under normal conditions?",
        "response": "To find out how much oxygen is found in a liter of fresh water under normal conditions, we can use the information provided in the passage.\n\nAccording to the passage, the solubility of oxygen in water is approximately 1 molecule of O2 for every 2 molecules of N2 at equilibrium.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era.

As there had already been a King George's War in the 1740s, British colonists named the second war in King George's reign after their opponents, and it became known as the French and Indian War. This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States, but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict, and that this was part of the Seven Years' War, a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain. American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years' War. Other, less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire.\nQuestion: What is the confusion of the French and Indian war?",
        "response": "The confusion surrounding the French and Indian War is that the name of the conflict is not a universally accepted term and can be traced back to different naming conventions in different regions and historical contexts. Here are some of the sources of confusion:\n\n1. Multiple names: As you mentioned, the conflict is also known as King George's War, Queen Anne's War, and the Seven Years' War. This can create confusion among historians and readers who are not familiar with the different naming conventions.\n2. British vs. Indian involvement: The name \"French and Indian War\" can be misleading because it suggests that the conflict was primarily between the French and the Indians, when in fact, many Indians fought on both sides of the conflict. This can obscure the fact that the war was not just a conflict between the French and the British, but also involved various Indian tribes and alliances.\n3. Global context: The French and Indian War was part of a larger conflict known as the Seven Years' War, which involved many European powers, including France, Great Britain, and the Spanish Empire. This global context can make it difficult to understand the specific nature of the conflict in North America.\n4. Colonial vs. national perspective: The war took place during a time when the British colonies in North America were still developing their own identity and sense of nationalism. As a result, the war may have been seen as a conflict between the British and the French, rather than a conflict between different Native American tribes and European powers.\n\nOverall, the confusion surrounding the French and Indian War is a result of the complex historical context in which it took place, including the different naming conventions, the involvement of various Indian tribes, and the broader global conflict."

In contrast to many other parliamentary systems, Parliament elects a First Minister from a number of candidates at the beginning of each parliamentary term (after a general election). Any member can put their name forward to be First Minister, and a vote is taken by all members of Parliament. Normally, the leader of the largest party is returned as First Minister, and head of the Scottish Government. Theoretically, Parliament also elects the Scottish Ministers who form the government of Scotland and sit in the Scottish cabinet, but such ministers are, in practice, appointed to their roles by the First Minister. Junior ministers, who do not attend cabinet, are also appointed to assist Scottish ministers in their departments. Most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected MSPs, with the exception of Scotland's Chief Law Officers: the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General.

It ceded French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River (including New Orleans) to its ally Spain, in compensation for Spain's loss to Britain of Florida (Spain had ceded this to Britain in exchange for the return of Havana, Cuba). France's colonial presence north of the Caribbean was reduced to the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, confirming Britain's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern North America.\nQuestion: What was the significance of British win?",
        "response": "The significance of Britain's win in the Seven Years' War (also known as the French and Indian War) was multifaceted:\n\n1. Expansion of British territory: Britain gained control over a vast territory east of the Mississippi River, including the Ohio River Valley, the Great Lakes region, and the Forked Deer River Valley. This expansion more than doubled the size of the British colonies in North America.\n2. Reduction of French colonial presence: France's colonial presence in North America was significantly reduced, with the loss of its territory east of the Mississippi River. This weakened France's position as a colonial power and paved the way for the rise of Britain as the dominant colonial power in the region.\n3. Economic benefits: The acquisition of French territory gave Britain control over valuable resources such as fur-trading posts, mineral deposits, and agricultural land. The Mississippi River and its tributaries provided access to the Gulf of Mexico and the port of New Orleans, which became a crucial hub for trade with the West Indies and Europe.\n4. Military advantage: The victory gave Britain a significant military advantage in the region, as it now controlled the strategic forts and trading posts that had been crucial to French expansion. This advantage would be important in the years to come, as Britain continued to expand its territory in North America.\n5. Diplomatic implications: The treaty had significant diplomatic implications, as it marked the beginning of a shift in the balance of power in Europe. France's loss of territory weakened its position in Europe, while Britain's gain strengthened its position as a major colonial power. This set the stage for future conflicts, including the American Revolutionary War, which would ultimately lead to the creation of the United States.\n\nIn summary, the British win in the Seven Years' War had significant consequences for the balance of power in North America and Europe, as it expanded British territory, reduced French colonial presence, provided economic benefits, gave military advantage, and had diplomatic implications."

This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path. Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.\nQuestion: Where does centripetal force go?",
        "response": "Centripetal force goes towards the center of the circular path. As the force is directed radially outwards from the center of the circle, it causes the object to move in a curved path and creates an unbalanced force that accelerates the object towards the center of the circle."

These forces cannot be described as gradients of potentials because the potential energy is not a conserved quantity in these cases.\n2. Macroscopic considerations: As you also mentioned, some forces arise from macroscopic statistical averages of microstates, rather than being purely due to gradient of potentials. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but it manifests as a force that is independent of any macroscale position vector. In such cases, it is difficult to model the force as a gradient of a potential.\n3. Emergent behavior: Some forces arise from the emergent behavior of complex systems, such as the collective behavior of many particles or the interactions between different components of a system. In these cases, it may be difficult or impossible to model the force as a gradient of a potential because the behavior of the system is not simply determined by the potential energy of the individual components.\n4. Quantum effects: At the quantum level, forces can arise from the exchange of virtual particles, such as photons or gluons, between particles. These forces are not necessarily gradient-like and can be difficult to model using classical potentials.\n5. Non-linear effects: Some forces, such as those arising from the non-linear interaction between light and matter, can be difficult to model using gradient-based potentials because they involve non-linear effects that cannot be captured by a simple gradient.\n\nIn summary, some forces are impossible to model as gradients of potentials because they involve non-conservative effects, macroscopic considerations, emergent behavior, quantum effects, or non-linear effects that cannot be captured by a simple gradient-based approach."

        "prompt": "Context: Newton's laws and Newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three-dimensional objects. However, in real life, matter has extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object. For situations where lattice holding together the atoms in an object is able to flow, contract, expand, or otherwise change shape, the theories of continuum mechanics describe the way forces affect the material. For example, in extended fluids, differences in pressure result in forces being directed along the pressure gradients as follows:\nQuestion: What may a force on one part of an object affect?",
        "response": "A force on one part of an object can affect several aspects of the object, including:\n\n1. Shape: A force on one part of an object can cause it to deform or change shape. For example, if a force is applied to one end of a rod, it can cause the rod to bend.\n2. Size: A force on one part of an object can cause it to expand or contract. For example, if a force is applied to one end of a tube, it can cause the tube to stretch or compress.\n3. Position: A force on one part of an object can cause it to move or change its position. For example, if a force is applied to one end of an object, it can cause the object to slide or roll.\n4. Rotation: A force on one part of an object can cause it to rotate. For example, if a force is applied to one end of a wheel, it can cause the wheel to turn.\n5. Stress: A force on one part of an object can cause it to experience stress, which is a measure of the internal forces within the object. This can lead to deformation or failure of the object.\n6. Flow: In fluids, a force on one part of an object can cause it to flow or change its shape. For example, if a force is applied to one end of a fluid, it can cause the fluid to flow in that direction.\n7. Vibration: A force on one part of an object can cause it to vibrate or oscillate. For example, if a force is applied to one end of a vibrating object, it can cause the object to vibrate at a different frequency.\n\nIn summary, a force on one part of an object can affect a wide range of properties, including shape, size, position, rotation, stress, flow, and vibration."

        "prompt": "Context: Unlike animals, plants lack phagocytic cells, but many plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant. Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. When a part of a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent. RNA silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication.\nQuestion: What is a mechanism that can help plants block virus replication?",
        "response": "According to the passage, one mechanism that can help plants block virus replication is RNA silencing mechanisms. These mechanisms can block virus replication by silencing specific viral RNAs, preventing them from being translated into proteins that can harm the plant."

They are divided into four classes (Type I \u2013 IV) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies. Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.\nQuestion: What type of hypersensitivity is associated with allergies?",

For example, in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found. These foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix.

The adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis. Legislation in member states which implements European Union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those who are subject to the law. In European Union law the general principle of legal certainty prohibits Ex post facto laws, i.e. laws should not take effect before they are published. The doctrine of legitimate expectation, which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and good faith, is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law.

Generally, \"prime\" indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1. It is either Q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name. Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots. Prime models and prime 3-manifolds are other examples of this type.\nQuestion: What does it mean for a knot to be considered indecomposable?",

In other words, a knot is indecomposable if it cannot be broken down into simpler knots by combining it with other knots.\n\nMore formally, a knot K is indecomposable if there does not exist a knot K' and a knot K'' such that K = K' + K'', where K' and K'' are nontrivial knots. In other words, K cannot be written as a knot sum of two nontrivial knots.\n\nFor example, the trefoil knot is indecomposable because it cannot be expressed as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots. However, the unknot is decomposable because it can be expressed as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots, specifically the trivial knot and the unknot.\n\nIt's worth noting that indecomposability is a property of knots, not of their representations as knot diagrams. Therefore, two knots that are represented by different diagrams may still be indecomposable if they cannot be expressed as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots."

        "prompt": "Context: Private schools in Australia may be favoured for many reasons: prestige and the social status of the 'old school tie'; better quality physical infrastructure and more facilities (e.g. playing fields, swimming pools, etc.), higher-paid teachers; and/or the belief that private schools offer a higher quality of education. Some schools offer the removal of the purported distractions of co-education; the presence of boarding facilities; or stricter discipline based on their power of expulsion, a tool not readily available to government schools. Student uniforms for Australian private schools are generally stricter and more formal than in government schools - for example, a compulsory blazer. Private schools in Australia are always more expensive than their public counterparts.[citation needed]\nQuestion: What is the comparison in price between Australian private schools versus public?",
        "response": "According to the text, private schools in Australia are generally more expensive than their public counterparts. The text states that \"private schools in Australia are always more expensive than their public counterparts.\" It does not provide a specific comparison in price, but it does mention that private schools are more expensive than government schools.\n\nIt is worth noting that the cost of private schools in Australia can vary significantly depending on the school, location, and other factors. Some private schools may be more affordable than others, while some may be significantly more expensive.\n\nIn general, the cost of private schools in Australia can range from around $10,000 to $20,000 per year for primary school students, and up to $30,000 or more per year for secondary school students. In comparison, the average annual tuition fee for a government school in Australia is around $3,000 to $6,000 per year.\n\nIt is important to note that while private schools may be more expensive, they may also offer additional benefits and resources that may be worth the extra cost to some families. These benefits can include smaller class sizes, access to better facilities and resources, and a more personalized and supportive learning environment."

        "prompt": "Context: James Hutton is often viewed as the first modern geologist. In 1785 he presented a paper entitled Theory of the Earth to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In his paper, he explained his theory that the Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediments to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land. Hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795 (Vol. 1, Vol. 2).\nQuestion: In 1785 James Hutton presented what paper to the Royal Society of Edinburgh?",
        "response": "In 1785, James Hutton presented his paper entitled \"Theory of the Earth\" to the Royal Society of Edinburgh."

        "prompt": "Context: Ranging from about 1 millimeter (0.039 in) to 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) in size, ctenophores are the largest non-colonial animals that use cilia (\"hairs\") as their main method of locomotion. Most species have eight strips, called comb rows, that run the length of their bodies and bear comb-like bands of cilia, called \"ctenes,\" stacked along the comb rows so that when the cilia beat, those of each comb touch the comb below. The name \"ctenophora\" means \"comb-bearing\", from the Greek \u03ba\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 (stem-form \u03ba\u03c4\u03b5\u03bd-) meaning \"comb\" and the Greek suffix -\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 meaning \"carrying\".\nQuestion: Comb like bands of cilia are called what?",
        "response": "Based on the text provided, comb-like bands of cilia in ctenophores are called \"ctenes.\""

        "prompt": "Context: The outer surface bears usually eight comb rows, called swimming-plates, which are used for swimming. The rows are oriented to run from near the mouth (the \"oral pole\") to the opposite end (the \"aboral pole\"), and are spaced more or less evenly around the body, although spacing patterns vary by species and in most species the comb rows extend only part of the distance from the aboral pole towards the mouth. The \"combs\" (also called \"ctenes\" or \"comb plates\") run across each row, and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia, up to 2 millimeters (0.079 in). Unlike conventional cilia and flagella, which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 + 2 pattern, these cilia are arranged in a 9 + 3 pattern, where the extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function. These normally beat so that the propulsion stroke is away from the mouth, although they can also reverse direction. Hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction in which the mouth is pointing, unlike jellyfish. When trying to escape predators, one species can accelerate to six times its normal speed; some other species reverse direction as part of their escape behavior, by reversing the power stroke of the comb plate cilia.\nQuestion: Combs are called what?",
        "response": "According to the passage, combs are called \"ctenes\" or \"comb plates.\""

        "prompt": "Context: In southern Europe, the stage was set in the Triassic Period of the Mesozoic Era, with the opening of the Tethys Ocean, between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates, between about 240 MBP and 220 MBP (million years before present). The present Mediterranean Sea descends from this somewhat larger Tethys sea. At about 180 MBP, in the Jurassic Period, the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the Tethys floor, causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the Alpine Orogeny of the Oligocene and Miocene Periods. Several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally, generating the individual features of Mediterranean geography: Iberia pushed up the Pyrenees; Italy, the Alps, and Anatolia, moving west, the mountains of Greece and the islands. The compression and orogeny continue today, as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes.\nQuestion: Microplates squeezing and rotating created the features of what?",
        "response": "According to the passage, microplates squeezing and rotating created the features of the following geographical regions:\n\n1. Iberia: pushed up the Pyrenees\n2. Italy: Alps and Apennines\n3. Anatolia: mountains of Greece and the islands\n\nThese regions were formed as a result of the compression and orogeny of the Tethys Ocean floor during the Jurassic Period, with the two plates reversing direction and compressing the Tethys floor, causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate."

        "prompt": "Context: The immune system is a system of many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease. To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue. In many species, the immune system can be classified into subsystems, such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system, or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity. In humans, the blood\u2013brain barrier, blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and similar fluid\u2013brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain.\nQuestion: What are the agents detected by the immune system called?",
        "response": "The agents detected by the immune system are called pathogens. Pathogens are any foreign substances, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and toxins, that can cause disease in an organism. The immune system detects and responds to these pathogens in order to protect the organism from infection and disease."

        "prompt": "Context: The Rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine. The cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production, and utilizes the phase change of water (boiling water producing steam, condensing exhaust steam, producing liquid water)) to provide a practical heat/power conversion system. The heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser. The Rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications. In the 1990s, Rankine steam cycles generated about 90% of all electric power used throughout the world, including virtually all solar, biomass, coal and nuclear power plants. It is named after William John Macquorn Rankine, a Scottish polymath.\nQuestion: Along with solar, coal and nuclear, what sort of plants notable use the Rankine process?",
        "response": "In addition to solar, coal, and nuclear power plants, the Rankine cycle is also used in other types of power plants, including:\n\n1.
